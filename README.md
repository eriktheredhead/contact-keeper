# contact-keeper
Full stack MERN app for tracking contact information

This application allows a user to register a profile, login to their profile, and once logged in offers full CRUD functionality for creating and storing a users contacts.

As a user's contact list grows, the list can be filtered to find a specific user based on letter/number matching.
